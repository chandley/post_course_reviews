### tl:dr; 
# FORK ME && BUILD ME && PULL REQUEST ME

## Creating your challenge

1. **Write out your problem** on paper - both what the problem is and what you want to learn from it.
2. Sketch out how you plan to solve the problem
3. Draw out a first draft of your objects/data structure (if you're using a database think which tables you'll need and how they'll relate to each other)
4. Start with your first spec (doesn't matter where it is), and gradually build up your app spec by spec
5. When you're done [read this checklist](https://github.com/makersacademy/post_course/blob/master/Taking%20Your%20Coding%20Further.md#before-you-submit-your-pull-request) and refactor

## Submitting your challenge

To start the challenge, fork this repository. Once you have finished, make sure you have added [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) stats to your repository then submit a pull request. See if you can resolve as many [style-guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) violations picked up by [Hound](https://houndci.com) as possible and your Code Climate score is above 3 and then one of the coaches will review your code. Good luck!

> If you have done your project in Node, please add a Travis config file which will allow us to automatically run your tests and see if they pass. You can [read the documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/) or [this article](http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/gluing-together-jasmine-grunt-travis-ci-github-testing-front-end-code-has-never-been-easier/) for more help.

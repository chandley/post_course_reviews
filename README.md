## Submitting your challenge

To start the challenge, fork this repository. Once you have finished, make sure you have added [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) stats to your repository then submit a pull request. See if you can resolve as many [style-guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) violations picked up by [Hound](https://houndci.com) as possible and your Code Climate score is above 3 and then one of the coaches will review your code. Good luck!

> If you have done your project in Node, please add a Travis config file which will allow us to automatically run your tests and see if they pass. You can [read the documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/) or [this article](http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/gluing-together-jasmine-grunt-travis-ci-github-testing-front-end-code-has-never-been-easier/) for more help.

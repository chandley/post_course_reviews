Submitting your challenge
-----

To start the challenge, fork this repository. Once you have finished, make sure you have added Code Climate stats to your repository then submit a pull request. See if you can resolve as many style-guide violations picked up by Hound as possible and your Code Climate score is above 3 and then one of the coaches will review your code. Good luck!
